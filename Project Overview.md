# Predicting % of Income someone will donate based on geography and other socioeconomic factors

1. Business Understanding

I want to understand what socioeconomic, geographic, and/or demographic factors influence whether someone will donate, and if so, how much of their income they donate.

This could influence the demographics we target for our Donation Marketplace.

Objectives:
- Determine what demographic/socioeconomic factors influence how much someone will donate
- Determine what geographic factors influence how much someone will donate
- Predict what % of income a US citizen from Utah will donate based on:

Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Factors that may influence what % of income someone will donate:
* religious affiliation (what is the most common religion in this area and what % of residents are of this religion)
* income level 
* adjusted gross income
* population of zip code (population density?)
* average age of zip code
* # of dependents
* political affiliation
* median housing price in area
* amount of diversity in their area

2. Data Understanding

Census data:
https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles/2018/

Census data is actually downloaded from this link for all zip codes in Utah for 2019 only
https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?d=ACS%201-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP1Y2019.DP02

Provides interesting fields per zip code in Utah such as:
- 
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

- First look at IRS data by zip code and look at current charitable contributions
- 

First Part:
1 income level, all counties in Utah

- What is the relationship between adjusted gross income and % of income donated?

* 

Looking at IRS data only first, what factors could influence how much someone donates? 

Per county, what is the relationship between amt donated and:
- avg # of dependents
- avg adjusted gross income
- avg unemployment compensation
- personal property taxes
- earned income credit
